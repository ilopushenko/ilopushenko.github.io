  abstract    = {Polarimetry with quantum light promises improved measurements for various scenarios. However, fundamental understanding of quantum photonic state transport in complex, real media and tools to interpret the state after interaction with the sample are still lacking. Here, we theoretically and experimentally explore the evolution of polarization-entangled states in a turbid medium on example of tissue phantoms. By elaborating mathematical relationship between Wolf's coherency matrix and density matrix, we introduce a versatile framework describing the transfer of entangled photons in turbid environments with polarization tracking and resulting quantum state representation with the density operator. Experimentally, we reveal a robust trend in the state evolution depending on the reduced scattering coefficient of the medium. Our theoretical predictions correlate with experimental findings, while the model extends the study by photonic states with different degrees of entanglement. The presented results pave the way for quantitative quantum photonic sensing enabling applications ranging from biomedical diagnostics to remote sensing.},

  abstract    = {<b>Significance</b><br />
Phase retardation of circularly polarized light (CPL), backscattered by biological tissue, is used extensively for quantitative evaluation of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, presence of senile Alzheimer’s plaques, and characterization of biotissues with optical anisotropy. The Stokes polarimetry and Mueller matrix approaches demonstrate high potential in definitive non-invasive cancer diagnosis and tissue characterization. The ultimate understanding of CPL interaction with tissues is essential for advancing medical diagnostics, optical imaging, therapeutic applications, and the development of optical instruments and devices.
<br />
<b>Aim</b><br />
We investigate propagation of CPL within turbid tissue-like scattering medium utilizing a combination of Jones and Stokes–Mueller formalisms in a Monte Carlo (MC) modeling approach. We explore the fundamentals of CPL memory effect and depolarization formation.
<br />
<b>Approach</b><br />
The generalized MC computational approach developed for polarization tracking within turbid tissue-like scattering medium is based on the iterative solution of the Bethe–Salpeter equation. The approach handles helicity response of CPL scattered in turbid medium and provides explicit expressions for assessment of its polarization state.
<br />
<b>Results</b><br />
Evolution of CPL backscattered by tissue-like medium at different conditions of observation in terms of source–detector configuration is assessed quantitatively. The depolarization of light is presented in terms of the coherence matrix and Stokes–Mueller formalism. The obtained results reveal the origins of the helicity flip of CPL depending on the source–detector configuration and the properties of the medium and are in a good agreement with the experiment.
<br />
<b>Conclusions</b><br />
By integrating Jones and Stokes–Mueller formalisms, the combined MC approach allows for a more complete representation of polarization effects in complex optical systems. The developed model is suitable to imitate propagation of the light beams of different shape and profile, including Gaussian, Bessel, Hermite–Gaussian, and Laguerre–Gaussian beams, within tissue-like medium. Diverse configuration of the experimental conditions, coherent properties of light, and peculiarities of polarization can be also taken into account.},

We reveal the dynamics of the backscattered fraction of unpolarized light, disclosing its decomposition into two fully polarized components characterized by opposite helicities. Concurrently, their superposition, driven by multiple scattering within the medium, leads to the appearance of a fraction of linear polarization. We emphasize that the in-depth binding of light circular polarization memory when the helicity flips occurs within the scattering medium, meaning the conservation of spin angular momentum. We anticipate that the results obtained hold significant implications for future studies, particularly in the field of tissue polarimetry and light vortices.},

  abstract  = {Plasmonic particles with scale less than 10 nm are known to exhibit unique scattering properties
related to the nonlocal spatial dispersion effects. These are not accounted for in the majority of
electromagnetic solvers that are conventionally used to simulate scattering by nanostructures.
Several nonlocal-corrected Maxwell-based models were recently proposed in attempt to
interpret dispersive phenomena in terms of classic constitutive equations and boundary
conditions (BC). Among these models Generalized Nonlocal Optical Response (GNOR) theory
with hard wall BC and an approach based on mesoscopic BC are being actively studied. For the
specific cases they both provide results close to experimental measurements.<br /><br />
Each of the Maxwell-based approaches (traditional Mie theory, GNOR, or mesoscopic) implies its
own scattering problem statement involving possibly modified Maxwell equations, BC, and
radiation conditions. For spherical particles these problems have analytic solutions. However,
corresponding analytic expressions usually must be coded independently because expansion
coefficients have to be obtained from scratch for each problem. For a sphere with present
nonlocal layers, it is a straightforward but practically cumbersome task due to the lengthy
expansions and presence of highly oscillating longitudinal fields.<br /><br />
In this work, outlined problems are solved with a universal computer algebra algorithm (symMie)
implemented in the MATLAB/Octave symbolic package framework. The algorithm allows user to
construct a set of BC (which could be either classic Mie, GNOR hard wall or mesoscopic) for a
stratified sphere optionally involving nonlocal layers. The code comes with symbolically
pre-defined full basis set of SVWFs (spherical vector wave functions, including longitudinal ones)
and field expansions. Moreover, it is not limited to them, enabling one to flexibly adjust
functional basis for the specific problem. Eventually, constructed BC set forms a system of linear
equations with unknown Mie expansion coefficients, which can be solved either fully
symbolically or with variable precision arithmetic allowing to constrain rounding errors. This
approach proves useful when it is necessary to obtain an analytic solution to a scattering
problem with spherical geometry given the lack of resources for an implementation of
problem-specific code.},

The routine procedure of morphological analysis implies time-consuming and laborious steps including sectioning and staining of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. We developed a multispectral Stokes polarimetric imaging approach that allows characterization of FFPE brain tissue samples to discern the stages of AD progression without sectioning and staining the tissue. The Stokes polarimetry approach is highly sensitive to structural alterations of brain tissue, particularly to the changes in light scattering and birefringence. We present the results of the label-free non-destructive screening of FFPE mouse brain tissue and show several polarization metrics that demonstrate statistically significant differences for tissues at different stages of AD.},
