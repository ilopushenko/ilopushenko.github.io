  abstract    = {We consider the origin of unpolarized light resulting from the backscattering of circularly polarized light by a turbid tissue-like medium. We reveal the dynamics of the backscattered fraction of unpolarized light, disclosing its decomposition into two fully polarized components characterized by opposite helicities. Concurrently, their superposition, driven by multiple scattering within the medium, leads to the appearance of a fraction of linear polarization. We emphasize that the in-depth binding of light circular polarization memory when the helicity flips occurs within the scattering medium, meaning the conservation of spin angular momentum. We anticipate that the results obtained hold significant implications for future studies, particularly in the field of tissue polarimetry and light vortices.},
