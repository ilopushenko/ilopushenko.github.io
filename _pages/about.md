Welcome to my personal webpage and thanks for stopping by! 

I'm a researcher at the intersection of computational physics, numerical methods and electromagnetics, with focus on wave scattering. 

At the moment I conduct <b>postdoctoral studies</b> in Finland covering the fields of biophotonics and mesoscopic electrodynamics, building simulation tools that help to acquire new knowledge in between quantum and classical physics. 

In perspective, I'm greatly interested in pushing forward <b>open science</b> and education through implementing software which enables to both visually and quantitavely <!-- demonstrate and process solutions to both basic school/university degree problems, as well as to --> <b>experience and feel</b> the modern problems in physics, all the way up from the school to the challenging cutting-edge level.

and corresponding educative <a href="#">blog post series</a>. More projects, covering both elementary ready-to-use MATLAB tools and advanced modeling software, are available in my GitHub repositories and documented in the <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1970-019X">research papers</a>.

I also enjoy traveling, reading, hiking with friends, and discussing philosophy.
